# Learning outcomes

By the end of this practical you should be able to:

- Explain the use of and differences between Git and GitHub
- Create reproducible and open R code

# The solution...

# Version control

# Version control


- It is not strictly necessary for *reproducibility*, but it can be hugely useful for *sanity* (and for managing collaborative projects, and for long-term efficiency).

The promise with formal version control:
.pull-left[
- Can make it easier to explore the history of changes.
- Enables you to go back to an earlier state to find the source of a bug
- Allows you to try things out without worrying about breaking the things that work.
- Can make it easier to incorporate changes from collaborators, even if you’re all making simultaneous changes to the same set of files.

# Using Git

.pull-left[
**Git is a version control system**. 

- Its original purpose was to help groups of developers work collaboratively on big software projects. 

- Git manages the evolution of a set of files – called a **repository** – in a sane, highly structured way.

## Attention

.infobox.caution[

Git normaly use command line tools (aka `Terminal` commands).
For the purpose of this workshop, we are not going to use this tools directly.

However, we suggest that people interested get to know a

# What is Github

.pull-left[
- Github is like facebook for programmers. Everyone’s on there. You can look at what they’re working on and easily peruse their code and make suggestions or changes.

- This is where hosting services like GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitLab come in.

# Is it going to hurt use Github?

Yes,

Version control is a tough sell.

It requires a big initial investment in time and effort, initial experiences are often rocky, and the advantages are mostly long-term.

**but**

We'll start baby steps by putting a single project under version control.

# What is the payoff?

 And it may seem like a big day-to-day hassle, though trust me that, after a month or so, it will become a natural part of your daily workflow.
