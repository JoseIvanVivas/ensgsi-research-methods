# I'm assuming...

You have working versions of:

- Github
- RStudio


So let's start

---


# Learning outcomes

At the end of this

- You will produce your first reproducible document and put it online 
- You will have a basic understanding of the main functions of Rmarkdown

---

# Agenda of this sprint

Two elements

## 1. Understanding the Rmarkdown

## 2. Connecting with github to publish your work!

**here**, you can see a typical single R Markdown file. <br>
This one is for a lab for visualizing data from the Museum of Modern Art.<br>
Let's quickly walk through some of the key parts of this file.

It starts with **metadata**, written in `YAML`, which is a list of keys on the left and their values on the right.

The first key you see is the **TITLE**, which is `Lab 02: MoMA Museum Tour`.

The last YAML section is all about **output**. Here the output is an **`html_document`**.

Beneath that, we can add options to our **`html_document`** 
  - for example, a table of contents, with the key **TOC** set to **TRUE**.

So that's the metadata, but the real meat in your R Markdown file 
is text written in **markdown**...

and your code, written in R. So these 3 things: (1) **Metadata**, (2) *Text*, and (3) **Code** make up an *R Markdown* document.

The real magic happens, when you click on the `**Knit icon**`, and see your file turned into HTML.
