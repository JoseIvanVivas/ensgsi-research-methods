# We are assuming...

You have know how works:
- Github
- RStudio

And you are eager to see the magic happen.

So let's start...

---


# Learning outcomes

- You will produce your first reproducible document and put it online 
- You will have a basic understanding of the main functions of Rmarkdown

---

# Agenda of this sprint


### 1. Understanding the Rmarkdown

### 2. Connecting with github to publish your work!

# What is Rmarkdown?

```{r, include=TRUE, out.width='40%', fig.align='center'}

**here**, you can see a typical single R Markdown file. <br>
This one is for a lab for visualizing data from the Museum of Modern Art.<br>
Let's quickly walk through some of the key parts of this file.

It starts with **metadata**, written in `YAML`, which is a list of keys on the left and their values on the right.

The first key you see is the **TITLE**, which is `Lab 02: MoMA Museum Tour`.

The last YAML section is all about **output**. Here the output is an **`html_document`**.

Beneath that, we can add options to our **`html_document`** 
  - for example, a table of contents, with the key **TOC** set to **TRUE**.

So that's the metadata, but the real meat in your R Markdown file 
is text written in **markdown**...

and your code, written in R. So these 3 things: (1) **Metadata**, (2) *Text*, and (3) **Code** make up an *R Markdown* document.

<source src="img/single-doc-knit.mp4" type="video/mp4"> 
</video>


The real magic happens, when you click on the `**Knit icon**`, and see your file turned into HTML.

Here is what we knit. 

--

<img src="img/screenshots/Single-knit2.png" style="
  position: absolute; 
  width: 91%; 
  top: -53px;
  right: 5px;
">


Using the **`THEME:`** key in our YAML, we changed our font and colors.

--

<img src="img/screenshots/Single-knit3.png" style="
  position: absolute; 
  width: 97%; 
  top: -45px;
  right: -51px;
">


--

<img src="img/screenshots/Single-knit4.png" style="
  position: absolute; 
  width: 73%; 
  bottom: 10px;
  right: 80px;
">



But **this is still local and stuck on my computer/ Rstudio Cloud**.
