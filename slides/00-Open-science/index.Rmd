## Reproducibility and Replicability

**Reproducibility**: 

Refers to the ability of a researcher to duplicate the results of a prior study using the same materials as were used by the original researcher (Goodman, Fanelli, and Ioannidis 2016).

- Focuses on the validity of the data analysis
- "Can we trust this analysis?"

## Reproducibility and Replicability

**Replicability:** 

This is the act of repeating an entire study, independently of the original investigator without the use of original data (but generally using the same methods).

- Important for policymakers and regulatory decisions


---


## Why do we need Reproducible Research?

- Avoid misconduct such as fraudulent data and plagiarism
- Data-intensive research (e.g Big data research)
- Distributed research

## Reproducibility concepts

Two key elements: 

- **Literate programming for enabling reproducibilty**
- Version control for enhancing transparency

*...for significantly better documentation of programs, and that we can best achieve this by considering programs to be works of literature.*

## Literate programming for enabling reproducibilty

*Literate programming refers to the use of a computing environment for authoring documents that contain a mix of natural (eg. English) and computer (eg. R) languages (Schulte et al. 2012)*

## What is R/RStudio?

- R is a statistical programming language
- RStudio is a convenient interface for R (an integrated development environment, IDE)

##### RStudio tool

- At its simplest:<sup>➥</sup>
    - R is like a car’s engine
    - RStudio is like a car’s dashboard

# Summary

- Reproducible research is important as a **minimum standard**, particularly for studies that are difficult to replicate
- Infrastructure is needed for creating and distributing reproducible documents, beyond what is currently available
- There is a growing number of tools for creating reproducible documents

**Some challengues**

- It is not the solution for everyone.

# Main goal of the workshop

- Create a first reproducible article
