# Rules of the Game {-}

Imagine this module as a marathon with many **sprints** (using Agile methodology jargon `r emo::ji("smile")` !).
Therefore,the purpose is that each exercise will give you a particular concept, with a particular result at the end.

Each sprint will consist  on a practical task to do.

A presentation will be delivered first to introduce the basic concepts and to show the purpose of the tool.
Then, you will have a tutorial with step-by-step instructions you can go through.

## Assignments for ARCHE Plateform {-}

After that, several questions or quest will be proposed. 

Some of the results are going to be upload to the ARCHE Platform to evaluate the comprehension of the module.
