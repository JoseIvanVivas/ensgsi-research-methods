We give you a warm welcome to the module of reproducible research for in ENSGSI master course. We care for open science and open practices. Thus, this website is hosted on GitHub, a open source plateform, where you will find the source documents and holds all the practical instructions and data. Acknowledgements and Inspirations This an introductory workshop on open data science course. Thus, we have taken inspiration of many people around the world and we thank to the following people (list not exhaustive) who have either contributed or provided code in repositories that have helped us style this book: STAT 545 rstudio4edu Hadley Wickham Alison Presmanes Hill Desir√©e De Leon Yihui Xie Robin Lovelace Twitter for R programmers Matt Ng StatQuest with Josh Starmer Julia Silge Jenny Bryan Garrick Aden‚ÄëBuie The R package and analysis artwork used within this book has been produced by allison_horst, whilst artwork used in information boxes has been produced by Desir√©e De Leon. You can find Allison‚Äôs images on the stats illustration GitHub repository and Desir√©e‚Äôs on the rstudio4edu GitHub repository. I (Fabio) have certainly learnt a lot from their open code repositories! https://erpi.univ-lorraine.fr/people/Fabio-Cruz/‚Ü©Ô∏é https://erpi.univ-lorraine.fr/people/Giovanny-Arbelaez/‚Ü©Ô∏é https://erpi.univ-lorraine.fr/people/Mauricio-Camargo/‚Ü©Ô∏é "],["purpose.html", "Purpose Intended course learning outcomes How to use this guide Self guided learning Noticed a mistake?", " Purpose This is an introductory workshop to the use of open source software on data analysis and data visualization using &amp; Rstudio tools. We try to make as easy and ongoing as possible, even for those who are not familiar with programming language. Nevertheless, we understand that the introduction of new tools can have been challenging in this Virtual courses. Intended course learning outcomes At the end of the session, we promise that you should be able to: Understand the process of create reproducible documents Have a first insight in the data visualization practices using datasets Experience the diversity of options that open practices to communicate your results. There are many references and information within this practical workshop book and we do not expect you to read everything we link to. However, this is a first step in order to get competence in the data analysis as it is required in a world of artificial intelligence and huge amount of data. Do be scare to use different tools other than Excel for analyzing data. You should look each exercise, go through step by step, and understand the concept behind each sprint. Good luck! How to use this guide Before we start, take some minutes learning how to read this online book. The first element is to understand this website. In the top right of this webpage you will see this tools bar: From left to right these buttons will let you: control the side bar search the entire book for a specific word change the text size, font, colour propose an edit if you see a mistake that I can review view the webpage in the ‚Äòraw‚Äô RMarkdown format, we cover RMarkdown in the course information about shortcuts for this book and most others like it In addition the icon in the top right of the page takes you to the GitHub repository for this book, we cover GitHub in the course, but it‚Äôs basically where the online files for the book are stored. Self guided learning It‚Äôs easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, ‚ÄúOh it‚Äôs me, I‚Äôm really stupid,‚Äù or, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not made out to program.‚Äù But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It‚Äôs just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don‚Äôt blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later. You're doing it right if you get frustrated: if you're not frustrated, you're (probably) not stretching yourself mentally ‚Äî Hadley Wickham ((hadleywickham?)) 11. Februar 2015 The lectures and practicals of this worskshop only form a part of the learning process. You are invited to undertake wider reading and explore new methods and approaches. We have provided guidance on useful resources throughout the course to use as a starting point but you are encouraged to go beyond our recommedations and fully engage with the world of open sience and visualisation techniques. Additional valuable resources You can also go through other free resources including: In french: STAT 545 rstudio4edu Hadley Wickham Alison Presmanes Hill Desir√©e De Leon Yihui Xie Robin Lovelace Twitter for R programmers Matt Ng StatQuest with Josh Starmer Julia Silge Jenny Bryan Garrick Aden‚ÄëBuie In english: Free RStudio Education resources Codeacademy YaRrr!

No one is perfect, if you notice a mistake let us know through the GitHub issues tab Don‚Äôt worry if you are unsure about what GitHub is we cover it in the course. Acknowledgments This module is always a Working in Progress. Given the fact that you will use it, and undertand, let us know you opinion on github. "],["software-installation.html", "Software installation Setup 1 (Reccomended): Setup 2 (For Warriors)", " Software installation Before we jump to the workshop, we need to assure that each one of you will have access to software that will be used. There are two main software that you need to get: Github R project. So, two options are proposed. Please, do these steps before the day of the workshop. If questions or problems, let us know as soon as possible Before the day of the course, we advise you to get functional access to these software / and platforms. Setup 1 (Reccomended): Github account Go to the github plateform: https://github.com/ Create an account using your UL email. Recommendations: This site will present the projects that eventually you will work. Make it professional!. You will able to valorise in your cv. Put your photo, a description of who you are. Use a profesiona nickname. Rstudio Cloud account Sign up for Rstudio Cloud Free version: https://rstudio.cloud/ Use you github account! Voila!, C‚Äôest bon RStudio Cloud is a webpage, so no installation is required. However, as you have notice, there is some restrictions in the quantity of project and the virtual machine assigned to you. It‚Äôs the best option to get start! However, if you feel capable to take the path of the warrior.. Setup 2 (For Warriors) Installing Git in your machine Go to Git https://git-scm.com/downloads Install you according to your machine (Windows, MacOs, Linux) Eventually install github desk R &amp; Rstudio Local R Go to R-Project https://www.r-project.org/ and click on download R. 2.Got to France, and select the a Mirror (Univ-lyon works normally well!) 2.Download according your machine and install Rstudio You can install R Studio on your own machine from: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download RStudio is a free and open-source integrated development environment for R ‚Äî it makes R much easier to use. "],["assignments-for-arche-plateform.html", "Assignments for ARCHE Plateform Final rapport of Scientifique publications", " Assignments for ARCHE Plateform Imagine this module as a marathon with many sprints (using Agile methodology jargon üòÑ!). Therefore, the purpose is that each exercise will give you a particular concept, with a particular result at the end. We did each sprint with a visual presentation to follow the each tasks. After that, several questions or quest will be proposed. Some of the results are going to be upload to the ARCHE Plateform to evaluate the comprenhension of the module. You will need to upload the following results. Final rapport of Scientifique publications At the end of this module, you will capable to write scientific papers and introduce some reproducible graphics. Nevertheless, take into our mind that: We hope that the you can develope using some of the concepts presented here.

So, Ce module a pour objectif de permettre aux √©tudiants de ma√Ætriser les bases de la recherche scientifique : recherche documentaire cibl√©e, analyse de documents (essentiellement en langue Anglaise), synth√®se sous la forme de la r√©daction d‚Äôun article, pr√©parer et suivre un protocole exp√©rimental et aussi l‚Äôorganisation et les modes de financement de la recherche. Le module est organis√© en deux volets : m√©thodologie de recherche et atelier d‚Äô√©criture Intended course learning outcomes After having taking this module, you should be able to: 0.1 ARCHE or not ARCHE?
