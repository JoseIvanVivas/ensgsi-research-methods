Hello Students We give you a warm welcome to the module of reproducible research for in ENSGSI master course. We care for open science and open practices. Thus, this website is hosted on GitHub and holds all the practical instructions and data. Acknowledgements ans Inspirations Thanks to the following people who have either contributed directly or provided code in repositories that have helped me style this book: STAT 545 rstudio4edu Hadley Wickham Alison Presmanes Hill Desirée De Leon Yihui Xie Robin Lovelace Twitter for R programmers Matt Ng StatQuest with Josh Starmer Julia Silge Jenny Bryan Garrick Aden‑Buie The R package and analysis artwork used within this book has been produced by allison_horst, whilst artwork used in information boxes has been produced by Desirée De Leon. You can find Allison’s images on the stats illustration GitHub repository and Desirée’s on the rstudio4edu GitHub repository. I’ve certainly learnt a lot from their open code repositories! https://erpi.univ-lorraine.fr/people/Mauricio-Camargo/↩︎ "],["purpose.html", "Purpose Intended course learning outcomes How to use this guide Self guided learning Noticed a mistake?", " Purpose This is an introductory workshop to the use of open source software on data analysis and data visualization using &amp; Rstudio tools. We try to make as easy and ongoing as possible, even for those who are not familiar with programming language. Nevertheless, we understand that the introduction of new tools can have been challenging in this Virtual courses. Intended course learning outcomes At the end of the session, we promise that you should be able to: Understand the process of create reproducible documents Have a first insigth in the data visualization practices using datasets Experience the diversity of options that open practices There are many references and information within this practical workshop book and we do not expect you to read everything we link to. However, this is a first step in order to get competence in the data analysis as it is required in a world of big data and huge amount of data. Do be scare to use different tools other than Excel for analyzing data. You should look each exercise, go through step by step, and understand the concept behind each sprint. Good luck! How to use this guide Before we start, take some minutes learning how to read this online book. In the top right of this webpage you will see this tools bar: From left to right these buttons will let you: control the side bar search the entire book for a specific word change the text size, font, colour propose an edit if you see a mistake that I can review view the webpage in the ‘raw’ RMarkdown format, we cover RMarkdown in the course information about shortcuts for this book and most others like it In addition the icon in the top right of the page takes you to the GitHub repository for this book, we cover GitHub in the course, but it’s basically where the online files for the book are stored. Self guided learning It’s easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, “Oh it’s me, I’m really stupid,” or, “I’m not made out to program.” But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It’s just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don’t blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later. You're doing it right if you get frustrated: if you're not frustrated, you're (probably) not stretching yourself mentally — Hadley Wickham ((hadleywickham?)) 11. Februar 2015 The lectures and practicals of this worskshop only form a part of the learning process. You are invited to undertake wider reading and explore new methods and approaches. We have provided guidance on useful resources throughout the course to use as a starting point but you are encouraged to go beyond our recommedations and fully engage with the world of open sience and visualisation techniques. Additional valuable resources You can also go through other free resources including: In french: STAT 545 rstudio4edu Hadley Wickham Alison Presmanes Hill Desirée De Leon Yihui Xie Robin Lovelace Twitter for R programmers Matt Ng StatQuest with Josh Starmer Julia Silge Jenny Bryan Garrick Aden‑Buie In english: Free RStudio Education resources Codeacademy YaRrr!

The Pirate’s Guide to R Let’s know if you find something valuable in your learning process to add here At the end of every practical there is a link anonymous Google feeback form, let us know if something is unclear and we will go over it in a future session. Noticed a mistake? No one is perfect, if you notice a mistake let us know through the GitHub issues tab Don’t worry if you are unsure about what GitHub is we cover it in the course.

Therefore, the purpose is that each exercise will give you a particular concept, with a particular result at the end. We did each sprint with a visual presentation to follow the task. After that, several questions or quest will be proposed. Some of the results are going to be upload to the ARCHE Plateform to evaluate the comprenhension of the module; You will need to upload the following results. Final rapport of Scientifique publications At the end of this module, you will capable to write scientific papers and introduce some reproducible grafics. Nevertheless, take into our mind that: We hope that the you can develope using some of the concepts presented here.

So, Ce module a pour objectif de permettre aux étudiants de maîtriser les bases de la recherche scientifique : recherche documentaire ciblée, analyse de documents (essentiellement en langue Anglaise), synthèse sous la forme de la rédaction d’un article, préparer et suivre un protocole expérimental et aussi l’organisation et les modes de financement de la recherche. Le module est organisé en deux volets : méthodologie de recherche et atelier d’écriture Intended course learning outcomes After having taking this module, you should be able to: 0.1 ARCHE or not ARCHE?
