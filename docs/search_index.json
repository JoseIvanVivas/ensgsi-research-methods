[["purpose.html", "Purpose Intended course learning outcomes How to use this guide Self guided learning Noticed a mistake?", " Purpose This is an introductory workshop to the use of open source software on data analysis and data visualization using R &amp; Rstudio tools. We try to make as easy and ongoing as possible, even for those who are not familiar with programming language. Nevertheless, we understand that the introduction of new tools can have been challenging in this Virtual courses. Intended course learning outcomes At the end of the session, we promise that you should be able to: Understand the process of create reproducible documents Have a first insigth in the data visualization practices Experience the diversity of the global spatial data landscape and evaluate the relative drawbacks and merits of different spatial datasets There are many references and information within this practical workshop book and we do not expect you to read everything we link to. However, this is a first step in order to get competence in the data analysis as it is required in a world of big data and huge amount of data. Do be scare to use different tools other than Excel for analyzing data. You should look each exercise, go through step by step, and understand the concept behind each sprint. Good luck! How to use this guide Before we start, take some minutes learning how to read this online book.

Self guided learning It’s easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, “Oh it’s me, I’m really stupid,” or, “I’m not made out to program.” But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It’s just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don’t blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later. You're doing it right if you get frustrated: if you're not frustrated, you're (probably) not stretching yourself mentally — Hadley Wickham ((hadleywickham?)) 11. Februar 2015 The lectures and practicals of this worskshop only form a part of the learning process. You are invited to undertake wider reading and explore new methods and approaches. We have provided guidance on useful resources throughout the course to use as a starting point but you are encouraged to go beyond our recommedations and fully engage with the world of open sience and visualisation techniques. Additional valuable resources You can also go through other free resources including: In french: STAT 545 rstudio4edu Hadley Wickham Alison Presmanes Hill Desirée De Leon Yihui Xie Robin Lovelace Twitter for R programmers Matt Ng StatQuest with Josh Starmer Julia Silge Jenny Bryan Garrick Aden‑Buie In english: Free RStudio Education resources Codeacademy YaRrr!
