There are many references and information  within this practical workshop book and **we do not expect you to read everything we link to**. 

However, this is a first step in order to get competence in the data analysis as it is required in a world of big data and huge amount of data. 
Do be scare to use different tools other than Excel for analyzing data. 
You should look each exercise, go through step by step, and understand the concept behind each sprint. 
Good luck!
