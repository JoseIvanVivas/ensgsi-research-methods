## Hello Students

 <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/casa/"><img src="general_images/casa_logo.jpg" width="120" alt="CASA0005 course" align="right" style="margin: 0 1em 0 1em" /></a> and a warm welcome to the module of reproducible research for in ENSGSI master course.

We care for open Science and open practices.
Thus, this website is hosted on GitHub and holds all the practical instructions and data. 

Data used within the practicals is available online, however occasionally websites can undergo maintenance or be inaccessible due to political factors such as government shutdowns.
